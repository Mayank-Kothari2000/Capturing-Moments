	<h1>Ionic Successful Photographers<br>"Inspirational Stories"</h1>
	<p>Taking iconic photography goes beyond just using a camera to capture a moment. A professional photographer is in the business of using cameras 
	to take pictures which are developed into prints or prepared as digital photos. Photographers know how to use cameras, take advantage of lighting, 
	use lighting equipment, work with their subjects or objects to make them look good and edit their work to enhance its beauty or a certain perspective 
	of the photo.</p>
	<h2><mark>Annie Leibovitz</mark></h2>
	<img alt="Profile" src="images/Inspirations/Annie-Leibovitz.jpg" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50">
	<p>Anna-Lou Leibovitz was born in Connecticut in 1949 as the third child of six children to parents with Eastern European and Jewish decent. Annie, 
	as she grew up being called, got her passion for art from her mother who was a modern dance instructor. Her family moved around a lot when she was 
	a child because her father was a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force. Her family credits her success as a photographer to their numerous moves 
	since she grew up seeing the world from the windows of a car.<br><br><br>
	Leibovitz created iconic images featuring influential musicians of the era like Elton John and Bob Dylan. However, despite her success, Leibovitz’s 
	work at Rolling Stones was jeopardized by her hard partying and excessive drug use. It was after her rehabilitation that she was approached by Vanity 
	Fair, a much more mainstream magazine.<br><br></p>
